I've finally got the lecture notes system(s) up and running. We have two separate parallel systems set up:

- [Transcripts of the notes as they are written in class][lecnotes] (the Lecture Notes link on the top navigation menu)
- [LaTeXed supplimentary notes][texnotes] (the Notes Repository link on the top navigation menu)

The latter are housed in a public repository on GitHub. If you feel inclined, you can correct typos in the source, send me the revision (or better yet, send me a pull-request!), and I'll merge it back into the repo. Alternately, you can just send me an email description.
