Just in the nick of time to help pick up the slack, we can now offer some liveTexed notes of the lectures so far, compiled by Jackson Morrow. Hopefully over time, I'll integrate these into the notes repository, but for now, all things are available:

 - In class lecture notes from my laptop
 - LaTexed notes on the github repository
 - LiveTexed lecture notes by Jackson Morrow



These are now all available from the navigation tabs on the site. Many thanks to Jackson for the assist!
