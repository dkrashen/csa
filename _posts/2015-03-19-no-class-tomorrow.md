Unfortunately, class will be cancelled tomorrow, March 20th, since I'll be travelling.

I'm currently working on some videos on the existence of involutions, corestrictions, and the Pfaffian Cayley-Hamilton theorem. I'll post them as soon as they are ready, so you can still have some central simple algebras during our extended hiatus.

Again, please share this post with your classmates, who may not be receiving updates!
