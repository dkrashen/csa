I've done some small updates to the [notes on the repository](https://github.com/dkrashen/csa-notes/commit/1cb63fc3e2d4f01451e224b2ef363f658df2b702), and [Jackson's notes](http://dkrashen.github.io/csa/LectureNotes.pdf) have been updated to reflect the latest lectures.

Next class (tomorrow), our plan will be:

- more on Pfaffians,
- existence of involutions,
- involutions of the second kind,
- corestrictions.

see you then!
