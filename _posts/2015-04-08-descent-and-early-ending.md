There are now some new videos available on YouTube on Descent, which may be
a useful suppliment to the ideas of a few weeks ago. You can find them
here:

Also, becuase Ted Chinberg will be talking Friday afternoon at Emory, we'll
be ending class a bit early to give people time to attend. Class will run
from 2:30-3:30 this Friday.
