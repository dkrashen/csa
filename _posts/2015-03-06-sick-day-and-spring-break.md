Sorry to say that I've come down with a fever this morning, and won't be able to make it to class. I'll try to make up for the lecture in some other way during the semester!

Also, next week is Spring Break for UGA, so we will not be meeting on March 13th as well.

As I don't have email addresses for everyone involved in the course, if you do see this message, please pass it on to your classmates who may not be getting the website update notifications.
